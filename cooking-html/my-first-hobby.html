      <center><h2>ARMENIAN DANCE BEFORE 1915</h2></center>

      The Armenian dance heritage has been one of the oldest, richest,
      and most varied in the Near East. The ancestors of the Armenians
      established themselves in Hayastan (Armenia) about 650 Before 
      Christ (B.C.) soon after the collapse of the Urartian Empire. 
      The geographic position proved both a curse and a blessing. 
      Located at a major crossroads between powerful empires, Armenia
      became a buffer state continually ravaged by invading armies, 
      but distant enough to retain its own culture and identity.
      The geographic location encouraged commerce and exposed the 
      Armenians to many other peoples: Phrygians, Syrians, Persians,
      Hellenic Greeks, Romans, Laz, Jews, Byzantines, Arabs, Kurds, 
      Seljuks Mongols, Osmanli, Georgians, Asiatic Albanians, Russians,
      and countless others. Armenian culture reflects many of these
      influences.
      Ancient Armenia was a feudal society, with each district ruled 
      by nakharar (feudal lord). these noble houses jealously protected 
      their prerogatives and limited the possibility of national unity.
      The unruly autonomy of these princely houses also hindered the 
      rule of would-be conquerors. As a result, this ruling class was 
      gradually destroyed by invading armies, to facilitate their own rule.
      The destruction of the nakharar class also destroyed the "high"
      culture of the native elite. The only surviving institution was the 
      Armenian Church, which became the dominent political, religious, 
      and social focus of Armenian life. The ecclesiastic orientation 
      of Armenian culture today reflects this phenomena.

        The traditions of many centuries contributed to the development of
        the rich diversity in Armenian dance. The dance itself is divided
        into two categories: dances (barer), which were executed to the 
        accompaniment of musical instruments, and song-dances (bari-yerker),
        which were performed to vocal accompaniment.
        Dances were usually accompanied by musical instruments. In the
        village, the most common instruments were davul / tahul (a large drum),
        and zourna (primitive oboe). Other popular village instruments used
        were dudek sheeve and mey (shepherd's flutes), and daf (tambourine).
        The sax was a stringed instrument commonly played in Western Armenia,
        with the tar being its Eastern Armenian counterpart. The kemenche
        (fiddle) was used as a folk instrument on the Black Sea, but
        elsewhere was used to accompany the songs and poetry of the wandering ashoog
        (troubadour). A village ensemble often consisted of no more than
        two or three instruments.In the cities, a more elaborate tradition of musical performance
        existed, with groups of musicians playing in orchestras. These musicians often
        played tar, oud, kanoon, snatur, nagar, kemenche, daf, dumbeg, and
        mandolin, or (starting in the 19th century) clarinet, piano, violin,
        and other European instruments. The music of urban ensembles was
        heavily influenced by urban "oriental" (Arabic, Persian, and Turkish)
        music.
